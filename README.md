My name is Jaden, I'm currently a junior pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity and a Minor in Mathematics at Colorado State University.

- Currently I'm also learning about essential cybersecurity concepts, including cryptography, user authentication, database security, and intrusion detection, with hands-on projects in ethical hacking and defensive programming.
